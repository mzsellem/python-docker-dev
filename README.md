# BeyondMD Projects #2/#3

The concept for my app is a basic patient chart. A medical provider can create, update, and delete a patient. I have also implemented a third-party api to "add diagnoses" to each patient's chart. On the home page, you can find a "Hello BeyondMD!" and a pdf of my resume. Lastly, if you click on the logo in the top left of the navbar, you will be directed to BeyondMD's website.
